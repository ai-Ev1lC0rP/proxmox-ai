## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Access to a Proxmox VE environment
- PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
- Ansible (for configuration management features)
- Ollama for local LLM capabilities

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/proxmox-ai.git
   cd proxmox-ai
   ```

1. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

1. Set up the environment variables:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

1. Run the application:

   ```bash
   # Option 1: Run with Chainlit UI
   chainlit run ui.py

   # Option 2: Run with Streamlit UI (more stable)
   ./run_streamlit.sh
   ```

### Authentication Configuration

To enable authentication for the web interface, set the following environment variables:

```bash
# In your .env file
AUTH_ENABLED=true
AUTH_USERNAME=your_username
AUTH_PASSWORD_HASH=your_password_hash
```

Generate a password hash using:

```python
import hashlib
hashlib.sha256("your_password".encode()).hexdigest()
```

## üìö Usage Examples

### Managing VMs

```bash
> Create a new VM with 4GB RAM and 2 cores on node pve1
> List all running VMs on the cluster
> Stop VM 101
```

### Managing Backups

```bash
> List all backups for VM 101
> Create a backup of VM 101 on storage local
> Schedule daily backups for VM 101 at 2 AM
```

### Performance Monitoring

```bash
> Show CPU usage for VM 101 over the last hour
> Get memory usage trends for container 102
> Display network traffic for node pve1
```

### User Management

```bash
> List all users with access to the cluster
> Create a new user john with admin privileges
> Show permissions for user sarah
```

## üê≥ Docker Setup

The project is fully containerized using Docker Compose with the following services:

- **proxmox-ai**: The main application service
- **postgres**: Database with pgvector extension for vector storage
- **ollama**: LLM service using Ollama

To start all services:

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Run the UI locally (recommended for development)
./run_streamlit.sh
```

Make sure to configure your environment variables in the `.env` file before starting the containers.
